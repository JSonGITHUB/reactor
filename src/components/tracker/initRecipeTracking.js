(An optional addition of molasses can help build up microbes that speed decomposition.) It is important to note that with any homemade fertilizer the ratio of nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus will be unknown. Here is how to make it:\nDesignate a five-quart bucket for the emulsion. It will always smell like fish after this, so you likely won't want to reuse it for something else.\nGet fish scraps from a store, or put your own in.\nLayer them in with leaves until the bucket is two-thirds full. The \"browns\" help control odor.\nTop the layers with a fish layer.\nCover the mixture with water, leaving a few inches of space on top of the bucket.\nSeal the bucket and tuck it away. Check it each day for a week, and then every few days, to see if the gas is building up. When you notice gasses begin to form, you should stir the mixture once a week.\nIt should sit for about a month. If you live in a warmer climate, it may tend to break down faster.\nTo use the homemade fish emulsion, strain out leaves and fish bits by using a fine metal screen (an old window screen works well). Avoid smelling like a fish by being careful not to allow it on your skin or clothing. Place the strained emulsion into a sealable bottle. Dilute about 5 ounces of the emulsion into 1 gallon of water, or dilute 30 ounces of it into a 5-gallon bucket. Apply to the garden.\nDon't get rid of the leftover scraps. Add more water to the bucket and start the process again. You can typically use the same material about three times.",

Prepare the Red chili Sauce (For Pozole Rojo Only)\nRemove stems and seeds from guajillo and ancho chilis.\nSoak chilis in 2 cups hot water for 15 minutes until soft.\nBlend softened chilis with garlic, salt, and the soaking water until smooth.\nStrain sauce through a sieve to remove solids. Set aside.\n2. Slow Cook the Meat & Broth\nPlace pork shoulder (or chicken), broth, hominy, onion, garlic, bay leaves, oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper in the slow cooker.\nIf making Pozole Rojo, add the red chili sauce now. If making Pozole Blanco, skip the chili sauce.\nCover and cook on LOW for 8 hours (or HIGH for 4-5 hours).\n3. Shred the Meat & Serve\nRemove the pork from the slow cooker, shred it with forks, and discard any excess fat.\nReturn shredded meat to the slow cooker and stir well. Adjust seasoning if needed.\nServe hot with cabbage, radishes, onions, cilantro, lime wedges, and tostadas on the side!\nVariations:\n🌿 Pozole Verde (Green Pozole): Blend roasted tomatillos, jalapeños, cilantro, and pumpkin seeds into a sauce instead of using red chilis.\n🍗 Chicken Pozole: Use chicken thighs instead of pork and reduce the cooking time to 6 hours on LOW or 3 hours on HIGH.\n🔥 Spicy Pozole: Add extra chili de árbol or serve with crushed red pepper.",

                "description": "Trim the brisket if needed. Season each side with 1 tablespoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of black pepper. Place on a sheet pan and set aside.\nPreheat the oven to 300F. Place a rack in the top most position and lower middle position. Hang your oven thermometer from the top rack in the center of the oven. Adjust the oven temperature as needed until the oven thermometer reads 300F. Prepare the vegetables and herbs. Peel and cut the carrots, chop the onions and celery, get out the herbs, measure out the bouillon, tomato paste, water, and uncork the wine bottle. Make sure you have an oven mitt handy.\nSear. Place the roasting pan across 2 of your stove top burners over medium heat. Drizzle 2-3 tablespoons of vegetable oil in the bottom of the pan, enough to coat. Let the oil warm up until shimmering, then carefully sear the brisket on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side. If you’re feeling ambitious and have someone to help hold the pan in place, use two tongs to carefully lift the brisket and hold it upright to brown the edges. Remove the brisket from the roasting pan back to the sheet pan to rest.\nVegetables. To the same roasting pan, add another drizzle of oil. Then add the chopped carrots, onions, and celery. Stir frequently until the veggies soften and the onions are starting to become translucent, about 5-7 minutes.\nTomato paste and deglazing. Add the tomato paste and beef bouillon paste and stir well until the vegetables are coated with it and it starts to brown and caramelize, about 3-5 minutes. Deglaze the pan by adding a cup of water, using the edge of your spatula to scrape any browned bits (the fond) off the bottom of the pan.\nAromatics and wine. Add the garlic and whole herbs. Stir to submerge them in the broth. Push the vegetables and herbs to the edges of the pan. Put the brisket back in the roasting pan and pour the whole bottle of wine over it. Cover with aluminum foil. \nBraise. Place roasting pan in the center of the oven. Cook the brisket covered, until the internal temperature reaches 195-200F internally, approximately 3 hours. Actual cook time will vary depending on the temperature of your brisket before going into the oven; a good rule of thumb is to estimate 30-60 minutes per pound.\nResting. Take the whole pan out of the oven and let it rest, covered, for 30 minutes. Then, remove the brisket from the pan, leaving the liquid and vegetables behind. \nStrain and reduce. Use tongs to remove the biggest chunks of vegetables from the braising liquid. Pour the liquid through a strainer into a sauce pot. Let stand for 2-3 minutes so the fat rises to the top of the pot. Use a spoon to skim as much of the fat as you can. Place the pot on the stovetop and bring it to a boil. Reduce to a low boil and maintain it for 10-15 minutes.\nSlice. While the liquid is reducing, carefully slice the brisket into ¼” strips. Return the brisket to the roasting pan. Taste the reduced braising liquid and add ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper if it needs it. Then pour the liquid over the brisket into the roasting pan.\nKeep warm or serve. Serve immediately or cover with aluminum foil and let rest in a 200°F oven to keep warm. Thirty minutes before serving, increase the temperature to 300°F. After transferring the brisket to a serving platter, pour the liquid into a gravy boat or bowl for people to spoon over their brisket.",

In the meantime, pat the fish dry with paper towels.\nAdd the high heat cooking oil, then sear the tuna on each side for about 60-90 seconds, until browned. The pan should be hot enough that it sizzles loudly when you add the tuna.\nOnce the bottom and top are seared and golden, rub any leftover exposed pink surfaces on the sides against the pan, to cook all exterior parts of the fish.\nThinly slice the fish, then arrange on a plate with the orange avocado salsa on the side.
