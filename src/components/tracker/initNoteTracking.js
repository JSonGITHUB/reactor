Higher tide is better for the bigger sets and lower tide makes the medium size sets more rippable in the middle zone.","isCollapsed":true},{"description":"Day 1","note":"Big close-out sets made things tricky but plenty of waves and opportunities to find an end and runners for high scoring opportunities. The rights allowed multiplie turns and were very rippable and the lefts allowed for high scores with just one manoeuvre on steeper faces.","isCollapsed":true},{"description":"Day 2","note":"Weather was a little dicey but the wind never bacame an issue. Off and on rain all day.","isCollapsed":true}],"isCollapsed":false}]'
